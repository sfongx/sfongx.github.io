                I am a December 2017 UMBC alum with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a former
                intern with <a href="https://transitscreen.com">TransitScreen</a> that lasted between May and
                August 2018. Between my personal projects and my internship, I have learned a handful of new
                technologies and frameworks since graduating, including Django, MySQL, React, CakePHP,
                Angular.js, and PostgreSQL. I have also improved my skills in technologies initially learned
                during my time at UMBC, including HTML, CSS, Python, and Github.

                As it may have been implied by the the company I previously interned with, I have a deep
                interest in transit. As such, my personal projects revolve around it.<br/>
